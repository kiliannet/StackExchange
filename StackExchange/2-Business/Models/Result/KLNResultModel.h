/**
 *  All responses in the Stack Exchange API share a common format, so as to make parsing these responses simpler.
 *
 *  The error_* fields, while technically elligible for filtering, will not actually be excluded in an error case.
 *  This is by design. page and page_size are whatever was passed into the method.
 *
 *  If you're looking to just select total, exclude the items field in favor of excluding all the properties on 
 *  the returned type.
 *
 *  When building filters, this common wrapper object has no name. Refer to it with a leading .,
 *  so the items field would be refered to via .items.
 *
 *  The backoff field is only set when the API detects the request took an unusually long time to run. When it is 
 *  set an application must wait that number of seconds before calling that method again. Note that for the purposes 
 *  of throttling and backoff, the /me routes are considered the same as their /users/{ids} equivalent.
