/**
 *  This type represents some stylings of a site in the Stack Exchange network.
 *  
 *  These stylings are meant to allow developers to subtly vary the presentation of resources
 *  in their applications so as to indicate to users the original source site.
 * 
 *  Applications should be able to gracefully handle these styles changes, though they can 
 *  safely assume that these style changes are infrequent.
 * 
 *  Note that colors can be returned either as six or three digit hex triplets.
